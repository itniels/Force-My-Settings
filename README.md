# Force My Settings

## About
A small app that sits in your tray and monitors your windows settings and makes sure they are set correctly

## Why?
My laptop has a bad habbit of changing the "repeat" speed of my keyboard at random to the lowest setting, and i want it on the highests! So i eventually got so tired of it i decided to make an app that checks the current value and sets it if needed for me.

## Features
- [ ] Start With Windows.
- [ ] Start minimized to tray.
- [ ] Keyboard Repeat Speed.

More features might come along, requests are welcome as well :)

## How much?
Free forever for anyone. :D
